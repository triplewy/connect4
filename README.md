# Connect4

This repo is a boilerplate template for a CLI-based Connect4 game. It provides the following classes:

**Connect4.java**

Represents the CLI interface for the game and takes care of user interaction.
This class is already implemented for you.

**Board.java**

Represents the actual Connect4 game. It contains the board and turn state. You should implement the TODOs listed in this class.

**AI.java**

Represents an AI player that can select the most optimal next column to place a Connect4 token. Once you are finished implementing `Board.java` you can try your hand at implementing the TODOs in this class in order to create an AI algorithm that can consistently beat you.
